## Drivers [Links here](../../../reference/drivers/2023)

- Intel Chipset
- Intel RST
- Intel Graphics
- Intel Wifi

## Hardware

- You won't be able to see internal drives until you run the Intel RST driver on some computers.

## Notes

- I use Pro for my Windows version so Bitlocker tools are available.
- Windows To Go will reboot during initial setup; in order to continue be sure to catch it and change the boot sequence to the external drive.
- I like to use a different wallpaper for my WindowsToGo installs to make it easier.
