# How to quickly get the mouse cursor back on a fresh Windows on a Razer laptop

I regularly reinstall Windows and on a Razer Blade laptop, the cursor does not work in setup or in initial boot.

Yes, I know you can just plug in a USB mouse but I didn't have one handy.

I found that completing setup with just the keyboard isn't too difficult.

These computers along with some others use a newer driver for the mouse, the Intel Serial IO driver. Windows update will install this for you eventually but it can take a while.

The other challenge is that I could not find a driver from Intel directly that worked.

I ended up using the driver found here:

[Lenovo Intel Serial IO](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds560465-intel-serial-io-driver-for-windows-11-version-21h2-or-later-thinkcentre-neo-50a-24-gen-4)

This will get the cursor back for you without waiting for Windows Updates.
